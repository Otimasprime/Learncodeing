<h1>Let's try the Computer Science Discoveries unit that introduces Web Lab - learn online</h1>
<p>Unit 2: Web Development
Grades 7 - 9
In Unit 2, students are empowered to create and share the content on their own web pages. They begin by thinking about the role of the web, and how it can be used as a medium for creative expression. As students develop their pages and begin to see themselves as programmers, they are encouraged think critically about the impact of sharing information online and how to be more critical content consumers. They are also introduced to problem solving as it relates to programming, as they learn valuable skills such as debugging, commenting, and structure of language. At the conclusion of the unit, students compile their work to create a personal website they can publish and share.</p>
